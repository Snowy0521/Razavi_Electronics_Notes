### Opening the loop properly

+ Intuition for remembering this table:
    + If the feedback k sensing the output voltage source to input, the output amplifier has very low impedance, so seperating, the feedback connected to input is shorted to GND
    + If the feedback k sensing the output current source to input, the output amplifier has very high impedance, so the feedback connected to input is open.
    + If the amplifier has very high input impedance, the feedback connected to output is open. vice versa.
