## The Miller Effect

+ So what happens if $A_V = +10$? $R_P = \frac{R_F}{-9}$

### Caution
1. Miller's approximation has introduced a new pole!
2. Miller's approximation has eliminated the zero.

+ $C_b$ stands for the capacitance between base and emitter due to discharge and charge(Transistor turns on or off)
+ $C_{je}$ stands for junction emitter capacitance
+ $C_{jc}$ stands for junction collector capacitance
