## Properties of Negative Feedback
### Gain Desensitization 
+ If $A_1$ changes due to various factors(temp.,supply, frequency, load impedance), the closed-loop gain does not change as much.


### Bandwidth Extension

+ Gain degrades to $\frac{A_0}{1+kA_0}$ but Bandwidth increases to $w_{p0}(1 + kA_0)$

### Modification of Input and Output Impedances with Feedback

+ Without the feedback and with the connected load the voltage gain dropped by a factor of two.
+ With the feedback and the same load the voltage gain dropped by only maybe 15%
+ The output impedance of the closed loop circuit has to be less than the open loop circuit.
