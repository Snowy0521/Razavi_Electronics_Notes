## I-V Characteristics of Bipolar Transistor
+ [see video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SueDJ13jLe8&list=PLyYrySVqmyVPzvVlPW-TTzHhNWg1J_0LU&index=16&ab_channel=BehzadRazavi%28LongKong%29)
### Combining Time Response with I-V Characteristics
+ The $V_{BE}$ changes with time, so does $I_C$

## Large-Signal and Small-Signal Operation
+ Large-Signal operation: the signal is arbitrarily large
+ Small-Signal operation: the signal perturbs the bias(operating point) by only a small amount.
