+ *$\text{Mininum}|V_{in1} - V_{in2}| \text{to turn off one side} = \sqrt{2} * \text{Equilibrium Overdrive Voltage}$*

### Example: What happens if $I_{SS}$ is doubled? 
+ The slope changes to $- \sqrt{\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(2I_{SS}) }R_D$
+ The circuit becomes more linear because it can take a larger input difference without "dying"

### Quiz: What happens if $\frac{W}{L}$ is doubled?
+ The circuit becomes less linear, because it can take only a smaller input difference before it "dies".
