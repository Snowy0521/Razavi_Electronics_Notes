## Diffusion
+ Movement of charge carriers from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.
+ The circuit density $J \propto \frac{dn}{dx}$, which n is free electrons, x is diffusion distance.
+ $J_n = D_n \cdot \frac{dn}{dx} \cdot q$, which $D_n$ for diffusivity
+  $J_p =  - D_p \cdot \frac{dp}{dx} \cdot q$
+ $J_{tot} = (D_n \frac{dn}{dx} - D_p \frac{dp}{dx})q$ 
+ The diffusion current decreases as we go further in because injected electrons recombine with holes in the semiconductor.
+ but in n-type doped Si, the number of holes are too low, no recombination, diffusion current occurs.

## PN Junction
### Basic Structure
+ A p-type Si piece juncture with a n-type Si piece
+ Its called diode
+ Its a single crystal, not melt with each other
+ charge neutrality: for n-type Si, 
    $n + N_a^- = p + N_d^+$

### Applications
+ chargers
+ adapters
+ voltage multipliers

### Behavior im Equilibrium
+ no external sources in two terminal, leave them open
+ with diffusion, majority carriers go to recombine with minority carriers
+ so the free electrons from n-type $n_n$ go from high contribution to low contribution, leave positive ions in n-type,
+ same for p-type, leave negative ions in p-type
+ so negative $n$ go from n-type to p-type (negative current), positive $p$ go from p-type to n-type (positive current), so cause a total positive current from p-type to n-type.
+ the shield of positive ions in n-type and of negative ions in p-type **(depletion region)** cause an electric fields, point from n-type to p-type.
+ the shields due to its electric fields oppose the diffusion electrons and holes, stop the diffusion current => equilibrium

## Questions
1. How do the charge carriers redistribute themselves after the pn junction is formed?
    + Diffusion to equilibrium
2. How does the pn junction behave under three conditions:
    + Equilibrium
    + Reverse bias
    + Forward bias
