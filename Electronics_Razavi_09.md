## Practical Diode Circuits
+ Rectifiers => chargers/adapters
    + Analyze circuit to obtain: I-V characteristics, input-output characteristics.
    + Analyze by studing the time response
    + Concept of 'Tracking', e.g., $V_N = V_X - V_{D, on}$, ($V_N$ tracks $V_X$, perhaps with a constant difference)
    + Capacitor: $I = C\frac{dV}{dt}$
    + Half-Wave Rectifiers: Diode in series with an output resistor
+ Limiters => FM receivers, optical communications 
+ Voltage Doublers => RF receivers, flash memories 
+ Level Shifts => general circuits
