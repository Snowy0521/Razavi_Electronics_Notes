## I-V Characteristics of Bipolar Transistor
+ see youtube video
### Combining Time Response with I-V Characteristics
+ The $V_{BE}$ changes with time, so does $I_C$

## Large-Signal and Small-Signal Operation
+ Large-Signal operation: the signal is arbitrarily large
+ Small-Signal operation: the signal perturbs the bias(operating point) by only a small amount.
