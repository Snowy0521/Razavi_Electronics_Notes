## Small-Signal Model of Bipolar Transistor
+ ![how we get this model](images/SmallSignalModelBipolar1.png)
+ ![The complete small signal bipolar model](images/SmallSignalModelBipolar2.png)
+ To find the small-signal parameters, we must first calculate the bias conditions.
### Question: What happens to batteries with constant voltage source in small-signal operation (analysis)?
+ zero voltage source is equivalent to short circuit
+ zero current source is equivalent to open circuit
+ Notation: 
    + large-signal quantities: uppercase such as $V_{in}$, $I_C$, $V_{BE}$.
    + small-signal quantities: lowercase such as $v_{in}$, $i_C$, $v_{BE}$.

## Early Effect
+ ![Early Effect: $I_C$ increases linearly with $V_{CE}$](/images/EarlyEffect.png)
