## Diode Models
+ Constant Voltage Model
    + Approximation:
        * if $V_D < V_{D, on}$, diode off, $I_D = 0$
        * if $V_D >= V_{D, on}$, diode on, $\frac{dI_D}{dt} = +\infty$, resistance $R = 0$
        * $V_{D, on}$ in range of $(700, 800)mV$

+ An Ideal Diode Model 
    + $V_{D, on} = 0$

---
## Reverse Breakdown
+ Reverse voltage $V_R$ large enough, causes large reverse current $I_R$.
+ Damage to diode 
---
## Circuits Examples
+ See video in youtube

--- 
## Bluetooth Receiver
+ Low-Noise amplifier to amplify the small signal 
+ FM Demodulator to decode the low frequency information signal from high frequency carrier signal 
+ A/D Converter 
+ Processing
