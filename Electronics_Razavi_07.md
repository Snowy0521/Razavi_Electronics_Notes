## Summary of Diode Models
+ 3 Models: exponential, constant-Voltage, ideal 
+ All models are nonlinear and distinguish between  postive and negative voltages, its called **Rectification**
+ The ideal model **passes** positive voltages, the constant-Voltage model passes voltages greater than $V_{D, on}$, and the exponential model passes voltages significantly if $V_D > (700, 800)mV$

## Application Example
+ Charger/Adapterï¼šHow high voltage swing (AC) 220V can be transformed to low voltage swing 20V for AC/DC converter to charge laptop?
    + Resistive Divider: heat up charger and energy dissipation.
    + **Transformer**
    + Half wave rectifier, make only postive half cycle of sinusoid signal
    + The total voltage in one cycle in non-zero 
    + Make the half-wave AC signal go through low pass filter, we get the DC signal
