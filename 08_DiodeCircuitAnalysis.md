## Application Example
+ Using two diode in series connection for supply voltage for a 1.6 V blue tooth device. so why use diode as devider not resistor?
    + $I_D = I_S \exp \frac{V_D}{V_T}$ => $V_D = V_T \ln \frac{I_D}{I_S}$
    * The voltage across each diode is a weak function of its current
+ A diode operate as a simple voltage regulator, it provides stable voltage for bluetooth when battery voltage fluctuates.

## Principles of Diode Circuit Analysis
+ Begin by assuming certain states for all diodes 
+ Check the final results against the assumptions
+ If a diode is about to turn on or off, it muss sustain a voltag of $V_{D, on}$ , but its current is small.
+ If a diode is on and carries a current, the current must flow the anode to the cathode.
